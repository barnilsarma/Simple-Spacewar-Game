# Simple-Spacewar-Game
Hello, thanks a lot for checking out this repository. It would be a great pleasure for me if someone reviews the code and suggest some beneficial improvements. PLease feel free to do any necessary modifications to make the game more efficient and enjoyable. 

->  Overview:
This is a simple prototype of the classic Spacewar game which was created in the 1960s. Even though this one is a bit different, it is based on the same idea. In theory, there should be a rocket which the player can control. There are invaders moving in random directions. The player gets a point for shooting each of the invaders. While doing so, the player also has avoid collision with any of those invaders as well as the outer boundary.

->Game Controls:
1)  Left Arrow Key: To rotate anticlockwise
2)  Right Arrow Key: To rotate clockwise
3)  Upward Arrow Key: To move forward
4)  Spacebar key: To shoot

-> Libraries and Tools used:
This entire game has been built using python programming language. 
The libraries used are:
. pygame
. random
. math
. sys

The pygame library is the main component of the game. It provides the features and tools necessary to build a game. The lines of code are significantly reduced used the methods provided by the library. Math library is imported to perform some trigonometric calculations which are involved in the direction of rocket and invaders
